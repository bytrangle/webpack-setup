# webpack-setup
A series of Webpack tutorials to help you stop baging your head against the wall.

The master branch contains the barebone codes that sets up a one-page Express app to start following the first part of the series.

The branches represent the state of the codes at beginning, and end of each corresponding tutorial. For example:
* branch *work-with-css-and-bootstrap_beginning* represents the state at the beginning of a tutorial on bundling CSS and Bootstrap with Webpack
* branch *work-with-css-and-bootstrap_end* represents the code in the end, after installation of dependencies, configuration of webpack.config.js, modification of the route to serve assets etc.

## Setting up the project
1. Download a zipped file of the codes at the branch you want.
2. On your computer, create a directory you want to store the project files.
3. Unzip the code file to the directory.
4. Open the terminal and `cd` to navigate **into** the directory
5. Run `npm install` in the folder to initialize the project and install all the dependencies.

Everything else will be discussed in my tutorial series.
